About me:

✨  I am a creative mind and I am crazy about AI. My wish is to contribute to a better world by exploring the potental that AI can give us in increasing creativity, health and happiness.

✨ So, I have graduated with a Data Analyst Nanodgree from Udacity last year. I continue learning on various ML courses, now with Tensorflow and Pytorch being probably the next issues I dive in deeper. I am looking for ML and AI project where I can support and learn to gain more practical experience.

✨ Apart from my *beginning* coding career path, I have a number of year of business experience in finance and supply chain - and I am on a mission to bring AI to more organizations, in an understandable way.
