✨ About me ✨  

:small_red_triangle: I am a creative mind and I am crazy about AI. My wish is to contribute to a better world by exploring the potental that AI can give us in increasing creativity, health and happiness. :small_red_triangle: 

:woman_student: So, I have graduated with a Data Analyst Nanodgree from Udacity last year. I continue learning on various ML courses, now with Tensorflow and Pytorch being probably the next issues I dive in deeper. I am looking for ML and AI project where I can support and learn to gain more practical experience. :woman_student:

✨ Apart from my *beginning* coding career path, I have a number of year of business experience in finance and supply chain - and I am on a mission to bring AI to more organizations, in an understandable way. ✨

### :small_red_triangle: The Delta Project - Manifest :small_red_triangle:
My aim is to use state-of-the-art technology to make the world more caring and social. We will use the knowdledge about the functions of the psychology, neurology, about economics, educationa and soialization to achieve improvements towards more wealth, health, caring for every living, now and in future. I understand that this is an incremental process. Every little step will create change towards the better.

Why use methods like storytelling only for profits?
